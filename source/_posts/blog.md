Again. I start to build my blog again.

This time I decided to build a place for writing, which has to satisfy the following requirements:

1. **Simple.** I normally write some interspersed notes on Notion. If I have some mature opinions, which can form a relativly structured artical, I will put them on my blog. So the keypoint is I want to focus on writing instead of a fancy website.
2. **Multilanguage.** My articles should be easily support multilanguages. Currently I want to write in Chinese and English, mainly English(coz I want to practice more).
3. **Support comments.** I want to get some feedback or communicate with others.

Thatâ€™s all.
